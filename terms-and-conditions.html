                    <p>
                        While ITLOTP is a news source that provides unbias news, it originated as a passion project aimed to help educate others
                        about current events. While the influence of politics increases, politicaly literacy does not increase at the same rate.
                        That is why ITLOTP works to increase political literacy while helping people form their own political opinions.
